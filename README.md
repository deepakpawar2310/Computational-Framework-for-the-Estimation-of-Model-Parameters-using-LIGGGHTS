Procedure for triaxial compression in LIGGGHTS: (a) Initial sample after
pouring of monodisperse particles in simulation domain, (b) Hydrostatic
compression and (c) Triaxial compression.


2. Working of servo-wall in LIGGGHTS for constant stresses.pdf
Flowchart describing (a) Triaxial simulation setup, (b) Steps related to
working of servo-wall and (c) Convergence of constant force on servo-wall.
Note that the PID controller ensures only the constancy of a specified force on
the servo walls, not the stress.
